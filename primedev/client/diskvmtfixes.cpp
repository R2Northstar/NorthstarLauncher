	// in retail VMTs will never load if cache read is invalid due to a special case for them in KeyValues::LoadFromFile
	// this effectively makes it impossible to load them from mods because we invalidate cache for doing this
	// so uhh, stop that from happening

	// tbh idk why they even changed any of this what's the point it looks like it works fine who cares my god

	// matsystem KeyValues::LoadFromFile: patch special case on cache read failure for vmts

	// CMaterialSystem::FindMaterial: don't call function that crashes if previous patch is applied
